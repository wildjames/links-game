TODO:
  - Having categories and words both defined is redundant. Only pass in the categories.
  - Add some styling to the creator to indicate that rows are categories. Colour the background
  - When the user guesses correctly on the game, the tiles should turn the same colour
  - When the user guesses correctly on the game, the tiles should move up to the next top row
  - Have a small database, that can link a short UUID to a game definition string, so that we can send minified links
